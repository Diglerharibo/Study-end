# Study-end
    About a week ago my first course master degree was ended. As it commonly occurs, that it is hard to mix programming with higher education. So there was a month where i couldn't find enough time to learn something new. By the way, i tried to implement telegram bot with TELEBOT framework, where i tried to make pairs with students which listened for same course as me and had to check homework in pairs while exchanging their works. So it was an interesting experience. 
    Today I have enough free time to learn programming and i want to focus on several tasks. First one is Django framework, because each vacancy lists this skill as required. Also i feel important to end machine learning course at coursera site which i took about 4 years ago and can't end it with my current knowledge at that moment. PostgreSQL also seems to be useful, so i plan to learn it. All this stuff i would like to season with book about computer science and statistics.
    If I succeed in all the points that I have set, I will be happy.
